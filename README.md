### Hi there 👋

I'm a researcher at DFKI and PhD student at the University of Luebeck.
My interests are in bridging the gap between eHealth data and AI. 
I'm currently working in the [AI-CARE](https://ai-care-cancer.de/) project, where we aim to analyze cancer registry data using machine learning models.
